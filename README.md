# Number-Guessing-Game
 
Much like the rock-paper-scissors game, this game is also a project idea by SoftUni. And in much the same what I coded it, then made it keep going until the user says to stop. 

The premise of the game is rather simple: the computer chooses a number between 1 and a 100 and the user needs to guess it. The program runs until the user guesses correctly and then it prompts the user if he/she wants to continue or quit.
